# Team-TRM
Info on the old TRM offbrand from my YouTube era (2015-2018) 

***

## About

See above. Team TRM was an old brand during my YouTube era that was removed in 2017, but stayed until the end of the career. It is inspired by the British YouTuber [Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DanTDM)[TDM](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDiamondMinecart) and his channel brand "Team TDM" (TDM = The Diamond Minecart)

![Reference image failed to load. Image was moved, or is corrupt. Try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, search for the file.](/TeamTDMAnnouncement_Reference.jpeg)

This was a weird part of my life. I wasn't fully aware of how things worked at this time. There are thousands of other TeamTDM knockoffs, this is another one of them.

Team TRM stands for The iRon Melon. It should have been an I, but team TIM didn't sound like a good idea at the time, as my name is not Timophy, and it really wouldn't fit.

Here is a list of the YouTube channels using TRM branding (GitHub links)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
